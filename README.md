#2013-06-blackjack

This is a copy of the work I did on a private repo, originally a project from
the [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com) curriculum. I went well beyond the prompt of this assignment; please check out the Poker branch of this project in which I independently altered the ruleset to allow for a basic five-card draw poker game.

For a better perspective on my own work, please see [2013-06-clammor](https://github.com/quetzaluz/2013-06-clammor).
